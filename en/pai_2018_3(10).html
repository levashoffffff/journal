<p>SPLITTING A SOLID TEXT INTO WORDS</p>

<p><b>Summary: </b> The paper proposes a method for splitting continuous (without spaces) line of Russian-language text into separate words. The method uses work with a dictionary containing a large number of Russian word forms along with their morphological information. The array of word forms represented as a tree that provides a quick search. Selecting the first word starts with a character input from the beginning to the moment when the search result in the tree matches the entered substring. If you continue input to the end, additional variants of the first word may arise. Each variant is removed from the text and the second word is similarly searched. Choosing the correct variant among the arising splitting variants based on the principle of word count minimization and the deletion of variants that does not conform to the rules of Russian grammar.</p>
<p><b>Keywords:</b> prefix tree, word division, morphological information.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Summary: </b> A methodology has been developed for analytical studies of transient processes in ventilation control systems for areas that have differentiating properties, forcing a change in the ventilation regime. The stability of the proposed closed ventilation control system for non-minimal phase-type sections is substantiated, and the range of optimal regulator settings is determined. Efficiency and correctness of the proposed solutions is justified by the mathematical modeling of control systems for ventilating areas in typical operating modes.</p>
